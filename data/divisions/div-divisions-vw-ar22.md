## <span id="page-1-0"></span>Brands and Business Fields

In fiscal year 2022, the Volkswagen Group found itself confronted by the challenges of a difficult market environment worldwide, the limited availability of parts, and disruption in the logistics chain.

### **GROUP STRUCTURE**

The Volkswagen Group consists of two divisions: the Automotive Division and the Financial Services Division. The Automotive Division comprises the Passenger Cars, Commercial Vehicles and Power Engineering business areas. Activities of the Automotive Division comprise in particular the development of vehicles, engines and vehicle software, and the production and sale of passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, trucks, buses and motorcycles, as well as businesses for genuine parts, large-bore diesel engines, turbomachinery and propulsion components. Mobility solutions are gradually being added to the range. The Ducati brand is allocated to the Audi brand and thus to the Passenger Cars Business Area. Navistar has supplemented the brands in the Commercial Vehicles Business Area since July 1, 2021. The Financial Services Division's activities comprise dealer and customer financing, vehicle leasing, direct banking and insurance activities, fleet management and mobility services. At the beginning of 2022, we aligned the reporting structure by brand and business field with the Group's current strategy and management structure.


{2}------------------------------------------------

In this chapter, we present the key volume and financial data relating to the Group brands and to Volkswagen Financial Services. In light of the considerable importance of the development of business in the world's largest single market for the Volkswagen Group, we also report on business developments and the results of our activities in China in this chapter.

The production figures and deliveries to customers are differentiated by vehicle brands and their models that carry the corresponding brand logo. Unit sales figures contain vehicles sold by respective brand companies, including models of other Group brands. In some cases, there are marked differences between delivery figures and unit sales as a result of our business development in China.

### **KEY FIGURES BY MARKET**

The business of the Volkswagen Group and its brands was affected in 2022 by the difficult market environment worldwide, the limited availability of parts, and disruption in the logistics chain. The Volkswagen Group generated an operating result before special items of €22.5 (20.0) billion in the reporting period. Special items resulting from the diesel issue weighed on operating result in the amount of €–0.4 (–0.8) billion.

The Volkswagen Group's unit sales in the reporting year stood at 8.5 (8.6) million vehicles. Sales revenue increased by 11.6% to €279.2 billion. Improved price positioning and mix and exchange rate effects had a positive impact.

In the Europe/Other markets region, unit sales decreased by 6.2% year-on-year to 3.5 million vehicles. However, positive mix effects and improved price positioning helped to lift sales revenue to €154.5 (145.6) billion.

Unit sales in the North American markets increased by 7.8% to 868 thousand vehicles in 2022. Sales revenue increased to €60.1 (45.3) billion, due mainly to the inclusion of Navistar as of July 1, 2021, as well as exchange rate effects.

On markets in the South America region, we sold 487 thousand vehicles in 2022, a decrease of 3.2% compared with 2021. Sales revenue increased by 40.2% to €15.5 billion due to mix and exchange rate effects.

In the Asia-Pacific region, the Volkswagen Group's unit sales – including the Chinese joint ventures – increased to 3.6 (3.5) million vehicles in 2022. Sales revenue improved to €51.4 (48.7) billion. Negative effects resulting from lower volumes – not including the Chinese Joint Ventures – were offset by positive exchange rate effects. This figure does not include the sales revenue of our equity-accounted Chinese joint ventures.

Hedging transactions relating to sales revenue in foreign currency had a negative impact of €–2.3 (–0.4) billion on the sales revenue of the Volkswagen Group in the reporting year.

## Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand

<span id="page-4-0"></span>In fiscal year 2022, the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand celebrated the market debut of the ID.4 Pro 4Motion, the all-electric all-rounder for everyday and leisure use. The operating result improved year-on-year.

### **BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT**

The Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand aims to move people. The centerpiece of the ACCELERATE 2030 strategy is a global initiative through which the brand aspires to transform itself into a technology and software business focused on customer needs.

In fiscal year 2022, the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand launched the ID.4 Pro 4Motion, the all-electric all-rounder for everyday and leisure use. The powerful, assertive exterior features soft, gentle transitions, alternating with sharp, defined edges, and gives the all-rounder excellent aerodynamics. The powerful dualmotor all-wheel drive provides plenty of traction in virtually any everyday situation. Inside, the model impresses with open space and a calm design that emphasizes the airy feel. At the ID. Meet in Locarno, the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand presented its offroad concept car "ID. XTREME". The facelifted T-Roc models also celebrated their premiere in the reporting period. The new compact SUVs "Roc stars" boast fresh exterior design accents, improved controls and connectivity, and the latest generation of assistance systems. The popular Touareg and Golf R models also celebrated their 20th anniversary in the reporting period. The brand celebrated these birthdays with the Touareg "Edition 20" and Golf R "20 Years" special models.

The Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand delivered 4.6 million vehicles globally in fiscal year 2022. This was 6.8% fewer than in the previous year. The decline was mainly due to continued limited vehicle availability as a result of parts supply shortages.

The Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand sold 2.6 (2.7) million vehicles in the reporting year. ID. family models and the T-Roc were increasingly sought-after, and the new Taigo was also very popular. The difference between deliveries and unit sales is due mainly to the fact that the vehicle-producing joint ventures in China are not attributed to the companies in the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand.

The Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand produced 4.8 (4.6) million vehicles worldwide in 2022. In May 2022, Volkswagen Slovakia celebrated 20 years of Volkswagen Touareg production.

### **SALES REVENUE AND EARNINGS**

The Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand increased its sales revenue by 8.7% year-on-year to €73.8 billion in 2022. The operating result before special items improved to €2.6 (2.2) billion, which was attributable above all to improved price positioning, positive mix effects and reduced sales incentives. Increased commodity prices adversely affected earnings. Upfront expenditure for new products and technologies increased. The operating return on sales before special items amounted to 3.6 (3.2)%. The diesel issue gave rise to negative special items.

## ŠKODA

<span id="page-6-0"></span>ŠKODA added a coupé and two RS versions to its all-electric Enyaq model range in 2022. The Czech brand also pushed ahead with its India 2.0 brand offensive with the Slavia notchback saloon.

### **BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT**

The ŠKODA models are synonymous with smart understatement, featuring a superior spacious interior, the highest standards of functionality, excellent value for money and a distinctive design. Added to that are a number of "Simply Clever" ideas and new digital services, all aimed at making customers' lives easier.

ŠKODA expanded its all-electric Enyaq iV range with a coupé and two RS versions in fiscal year 2022. The Enyaq Coupé iV has an exciting design and, thanks to its outstanding aerodynamics, even larger ranges than the SUV version. The exterior features a gently sloping roofline that merges seamlessly with the boot lid. The Enyaq RS models have added another two models to the Czech manufacturer's RS range. With their two electric motors and a system output of 220 kW (299 PS), these are the two most powerful vehicles in the ŠKODA portfolio. The Enyaq Coupé RS iV was awarded the "Golden Steering Wheel 2022" in the mid-size SUV category in November 2022. ŠKODA also continued its India 2.0 brand offensive in 2022. Another model arrived on the Indian market in the form of the ŠKODA Slavia, which is based on the MQB. It offers generous space, extensive safety equipment, modern infotainment and two powerful and efficient TSI engines. Like the Kushaq, the Slavia impresses with a typical ŠKODA interior design and Indian design accents. Due to an intragroup restructuring, responsibility for the Russia region was transferred from the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand to the ŠKODA brand in 2022.

The ŠKODA brand delivered 0.7 (0.9) million vehicles worldwide in the reporting period. Sales in India more than doubled again.

ŠKODA sold 0.9 (0.8) million vehicles in the past fiscal year. There was strong demand for the Kushaq SUV model, and the Enyaq iV was also very popular with customers.

The ŠKODA brand produced 0.8 million vehicles worldwide in fiscal year 2022. This was 4.6% fewer than in the previous year.

### **SALES REVENUE AND EARNINGS**

The ŠKODA brand's sales revenue increased by 18.5% to €21.0 billion in fiscal year 2022 due to volume effects. The Russia-Ukraine conflict weighed on the operating result with an amount in the mid-three-digit millions, bringing it down to €0.6 (1.1) billion. Positive mix effects could not offset the impact from product costs and exchange rates. The operating return on sales fell to 3.0 (6.1)%.

## SEAT

<span id="page-8-0"></span>SEAT is one company with two complementary brands: SEAT and CUPRA. In 2022, CUPRA cemented its position as Europe's fastest growing automotive brand and increased deliveries by 93%, driving the financial turnaround of the company.

### **BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT**

CUPRA is the unconventional challenger brand that brings together emotion, electrification and performance to inspire the world from Barcelona. In 2022, CUPRA presented three concept vehicles for a new era of its vision up to 2025: the CUPRA Tavascan, as the brand's first electric SUV, underscores the brand's aim of becoming more global and entering new markets. The CUPRA Terramar is a sporty SUV with a powerful and striking design. The third concept model, the CUPRA UrbanRebel, is designed to democratize sustainable urban mobility. CUPRA reached new heights in 2022, led by the bestselling CUPRA Formentor. The brand's first standalone model saw deliveries to customers of 98 thousand units. CUPRA's second most popular model, the all-electric CUPRA Born, marked its first full year on the market with 31 thousand units delivered and multiple awards from trade magazines.

SEAT is the Group brand with Europe's youngest customer profile. In 2022, SEAT enhanced its SUV flagship, the Tarraco, with the Xperience equipment package. The brand also reached a major milestone with the sale of the one millionth SUV.

Deliveries to customers from SEAT and CUPRA fell by 18.1% to 386 thousand vehicles in fiscal year 2022, mainly due to the challenges arising from the shortage of semiconductors. However, the CUPRA brand increased sales by 93% to 153 thousand vehicles, thereby driving the company's financial turnaround.

The company's unit sales amounted to 468 thousand units in the reporting year. This was 5.2% less than in the previous year. This figure also includes the A1 manufactured for Audi.

SEAT and CUPRA produced 420 thousand vehicles in the reporting period. This was 0.8% fewer than in the prior year.

### **SALES REVENUE AND EARNINGS**

SEAT's sales revenue was up 13.8% to €10.9 billion in 2022. Positive mix effects, an improved price positioning and cost reductions drove SEAT's operating result significantly into the black, although oneoff expenses for restructuring measures of €247 million ultimately led to a result of €33 (–233) million. The operating return on sales amounted to 0.3 (–2.4)%.

##  Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles

<span id="page-10-0"></span>The highlight at the Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brand in the reporting period was the presentation and market launch of the all-electric ID. Buzz and ID. Buzz Cargo models. A second, completely new generation of the versatile Amarok pickup was also launched.

### **BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT**

As a leading manufacturer of light commercial vehicles, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles is making fundamental and sustainable changes to the way goods and services are distributed in cities in order to improve the quality of life, especially in inner city areas. In this way, the brand will continue to keep the world of tomorrow moving, with all of its requirements regarding clean, intelligent and sustainable mobility. This is what Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles stands for with its brand promise: We transport success, freedom and the future.

In fiscal year 2022, the Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brand brought the highly acclaimed ID. Buzz to the market. The vehicle symbolizes the core elements of tomorrow's mobility: e-mobility, digitalization, and connectivity. The ID. Buzz and ID. Buzz Cargo contain seven decades of "Bulli" know-how and also – thanks to the Volkswagen Group's MEB platform – an electric drivetrain. The ID. Buzz is agile, efficient and dynamic and combines the attributes of the legendary T1: from the design to the tight overhangs of the bodywork and the effective use of space. The popularity of the ID. Buzz is reflected in the many awards it received in its debut year, including "German Car of the Year" and the "Golden Steering Wheel 2022". The ID. Buzz Cargo impresses as a spacious and versatile zero-emission van and was named "International Van of the Year 2023". The new generation of the Amarok was also presented in the reporting period. Among other things, the versatile pickup offers optimized features, numerous assistance systems (some completely new to the pickup segment), mobile online services, two all-wheel-drive systems and an efficient range of engines.

Deliveries by Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles amounted to 329 thousand units (–8.6%) in the reporting period. Sales in Germany developed particularly encouragingly (+8.3%).

Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles sold 340 thousand vehicles in the reporting period, representing an increase of 4.3% compared with the previous year. This was also thanks to the ID. Buzz, which was very positively received by the market.

In 2022, the Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brand produced 351 thousand vehicles, 4.9% more than in the previous year.

### **SALES REVENUE AND EARNINGS**

Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles increased sales revenue by 15.6% to €11.5 billion in fiscal year 2022. The operating result rose to €529 (73) million, due mainly to factors relating to price and mix. Lower excess CO2 emissions premiums were taken into account compared with the previous year. The operating return on sales improved significantly to 4.6(0.7)%.

## Audi

<span id="page-12-0"></span>The Audi brand continued its electrification campaign in 2022 despite a challenging supply and logistics situation. The operating result increased significantly year-on-year.

### **BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT**

The Premium brand group combines four strong brands from the progressive premium and luxury segment: Audi, Bentley, Lamborghini and Ducati. "Vorsprung" is Audi's global brand promise, and one which means the brand with the four rings is consistently focusing on the premium mobility of the future: connected, sustainable, electric, and autonomous. In developing and scaling up innovative technologies, Audi plays a leading role within the Group, not least with the Premium Platform Electric (PPE) for all-electric premium vehicles.

Furthermore, it outlined the mobility of the future with two further concept vehicles – the Audi urbansphere concept and Audi activesphere concept. The Bentley brand presented the Bentayga EWB and Flying Spur Speed in fiscal year 2022. The Bentayga EWB is 180 mm longer than the Bentayga. Its emphasis is on wellbeing and interior luxury. The dynamic Flying Spur Speed grand tourer rounds off the Bentley brand's new portfolio.

In a difficult market environment, Audi (Premium brand group) delivered a total of 1.6 (1.7) million vehicles to customers in 2022. Increases were recorded in Germany (+18.7%), Italy (+1.6%), Spain (+1.4%) and Canada (+1.2%).

## Porsche

<span id="page-14-0"></span>Porsche added the versatile Taycan Sport Turismo to its all-electric Taycan model range in fiscal year 2022. Unit sales, sales revenue and profit increased year-on-year.

### **BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT**

Exclusivity and social acceptance, pioneering spirit and tradition, performance and sustainability, design and functionality – these are the brand values of the sports car manufacturer Porsche.

Porsche continued its path toward sustainable mobility in fiscal year 2022 and presented the Taycan Sport Turismo, the third model in its all-electric range. The Taycan Sport Turismo combines the everyday practicality of the Taycan Cross Turismo with the on-road dynamics of a sports saloon. It also impresses with state-of-the-art convenience and safety features, in addition to the latest infotainment. The addition of the new model means that the Porsche Taycan is now available in five variants. The most powerful variant is the Taycan Turbo S, which accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 2.8 seconds and can reach a top speed of 260 km/h. The Taycan 4S Sport Turismo boasts the largest range of all the variants, offering customers up to 498 km. Porsche also presented the 911 GT3 RS in the reporting period. The uncompromising model designed for maximum performance wows customers with features such as its modified central cooler concept and a significantly larger, swan neck-mounted rear wing. The model is available in the Clubsport or Weissach package. Back in January 2022, Porsche celebrated the 50th anniversary of Porsche Design and marked the occasion by releasing the exclusive anniversary model "911 Edition 50 Years Porsche Design", which is limited to 750 vehicles worldwide.

Porsche delivered 310 thousand sports cars to customers in the reporting period; this represented an increase of 2.6% compared with the previous year. Growth was achieved in particular in Western Europe (+11.7%) and Asia-Pacific (+1.2%). China remained the largest single market for Porsche with deliveries of 93 thousand vehicles.

In the reporting year, Porsche increased unit sales by 5.5% to 314 thousand vehicles. Demand for the 911, Panamera and Cayenne models was higher than in the previous year.

Porsche manufactured a total of 338 thousand vehicles in 2022. This was 19.2% more than in the previous year. The Leipzig factory celebrated 20 years of Porsche production.

### **SALES REVENUE AND EARNINGS**

Porsche Automotive generated sales revenue of €34.6 (30.3) billion in the reporting period. The operating result (prior-year figure before special items) increased to €6.4 billion (+28.3%), which was primarily due to higher earnings contributions and positive exchange rate effects.

## RATON Group 

<span id="page-16-0"></span>The TRATON Group recorded successes in all areas of the "TRATON Way Forward" corporate strategy in fiscal year 2022.

### **BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT**

The "TRATON Way Forward" strategy focuses on the following areas: being a responsible company, value creation and "TRATON Accelerated!". Successes were recorded in all areas of the corporate strategy in fiscal year 2022.

For the TRATON Group (TRATON), the future is electric. A total of €2.6 billion is to be spent on research and development for e-mobility by 2026, whilst existing investments into the development of conventional drive systems is to decline to less than one fifth in 2026. The establishment of a joint venture with Daimler Truck and the Volvo Group completed in July 2022 to create a high-performance charging infrastructure for trucks and buses across Europe will kick-start battery-electric transport. TRATON already joined the UN Global Compact in 2021 and was followed by the Volkswagen Truck & Bus brand in March 2022. In addition, TRATON has identified "decarbonization and circular economy" as one of three strategic focus areas for changing the business model and product design to achieve a reduction in CO2 emissions and resource consumption. TRATON is committed to the Paris Climate Agreement of the UN Climate Conference.

Stronger internationalization as a result of integrating Navistar enabled TRATON to counteract the significant fluctuations in the market in 2022. Moreover, Scania is set to become the first Western truck manufacturer to produce its vehicles completely independently in China; an important step for TRATON. By creating a Group-wide integrated business unit for financial services, TRATON is aiming to provide comprehensive customer financing services in future in order to meet the demand for new technologies and business fields.

In 2022, Scania was the first TRATON brand to introduce the Group-wide 13-liter powertrain in its Scania Super, allowing a reduction in fuel consumption in comparison to the predecessor model. In addition, Scania has set itself ambitious targets for decarbonizing the supply chain: by 2030, supply chain emissions arising from batteries, steel, aluminum and cast iron are to be reduced by 60% to 85%. Road tests for automated driving were expanded. The self-driving Scania trucks that have been upgraded to level 4 may now drive on all routes between the cities of Södertälje and Jönköping. A driver remains on board for safety reasons.

By digitalizing its vehicles, MAN wants to tap into new business fields. In 2022, it launched MAN SimplePay, making it the first vehicle manufacturer to develop a digital, transparent platform for all payment transactions involving commercial vehicles. In addition, a solution created with its partner BP for automated, contactless and safe payments for refueling went live. At IAA Transportation 2022, MAN unveiled the all-electric truck as a prototype that was almost ready for mass production.

In 2022, Navistar presented the International S13 integrated powertrain, with which a new level of efficiency, profitability and sustainability is expected to be reached. Based on the TRATON Group's 13-liter powertrain, the S13 enables fuel savings of up to 15% when combined with optimized aerodynamics. By opening a new factory in San Antonio, Texas, where electric vehicles can also be produced, Navistar is positioning itself as an e-mobility provider.

Volkswagen Truck & Bus expanded its importer network in Asia in 2022 and delivered the first vehicles to customers in the Philippines.

Despite negative effects resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the operating result of €1.6 (0.2) billion was higher than in the previous year. The figure for the previous year had been mainly influenced by expenses of €0.7 billion for restructuring measures at MAN Truck & Bus plus expenses of €0.5 billion for provisions recognized at Scania Vehicles & Services in connection with the EU antitrust proceedings. Additionally, mix and exchange rate effects had a positive effect. The operating return on sales increased to 4.0 (0.5)%.

## Volkswagen Group China

<span id="page-18-0"></span>In fiscal year 2022, the Volkswagen Group made further progress with its ambitious transformation in China, achieving significant growth in deliveries of all-electric vehicles.

### **BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT**

Despite the challenges arising from the Covid-19 pandemic and the shortage of semiconductors, Volkswagen Group China maintained its market leadership in China in 2022 with a market share of 15.1%, and continued to drive the ambitious transformation to fully connected e-mobility. With 206,500 vehicles delivered, sales of NEVs rose by 37.1% compared with the previous year, while BEV deliveries were up 68.2% year-on-year. The key driver of this electric momentum in China was the successful ID. family of the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand. ID. family deliveries more than doubled compared with the previous year. Another family member, the ID. Aero concept car, is already in the starting blocks.

Together with the Chinese joint ventures, Volkswagen Group China delivered 3.2 (3.3) million vehicles (including imports) in the Chinese market in 2022 (–3.6%). The Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand, including JETTA, delivered 2.4 million vehicles (–1.3%) and, with a market share of 11.4 (11.7)%, remained number one with Chinese customers despite the challenging environment. This figure includes 180,600 NEV vehicles (+51.6%).

In the premium and sports segment, Audi delivered 642,548 vehicles to customers in China. The number of all-electric models delivered was up 9.8%. Under the new "Vorsprung 2030" strategy, the Audi brand forms a cornerstone of the advancing transformation of products in China in addition to production and development capacities. Audi has further expanded its portfolio of all-electric models with the roll out of the Audi Q4 e-tron, Q5 e-tron Roadjet and RS e-tron GT models. Moreover, the Audi FAW NEV Company began the construction of its plant in Changchun. Only all-electric models based on the PPE platform will roll off the production line at this location.

In the past year, Porsche delivered 93,286 vehicles in China, its largest individual market. The electrification strategy has made steady progress in China in terms of both product range and charging stations. Porsche had introduced a total of 21 NEV models in China by the end of 2022, nine of which are the Taycan and its derivatives. Bentley celebrated its 20th anniversary in China in 2022 with total deliveries of 3,655 vehicles. Lamborghini's delivery of 1,018 vehicles represents a 8.9% increase compared with 2021.

Volkswagen Group China made considerable progress in its transformation in fiscal year 2022; the introduction of a new management model has facilitated rapid, autonomous decision-making and optimized cooperation among brands. CARIAD, the Group's software company, has established its subsidiary in China, thus systematically driving software development and digitalization. Moreover, Volkswagen Group China has announced a collaboration with Horizon Robotics in order to implement local solutions for automated driving together. In December, the first pre-series vehicle rolled off the production line at Volkswagen's ultramodern MEB plant in Anhui. Volkswagen Group China also drove the expansion of the energy supply network, creating, with the charging joint venture CAMS, more than 1,000 charging stations with over 9,000 charging points.

1 Produced locally.

Our joint ventures produced a total of 3.2 (2.9) million vehicles in fiscal year 2022. The joint ventures produce a mixture of established Group models and those specially modified for Chinese customers (e.g. with extended wheelbases), as well as vehicles developed exclusively for the Chinese market (such as the Volkswagen Lamando, Teramont, ID.6 X, or ID.6 CROZZ).

The proportionate operating result of the joint ventures in the reporting year stood at €3.3 (3.0) billion. The negative impacts of a highly competitive market environment and pandemic-related restrictions were offset by improvements in the mix and cost optimization.

The figures of the Chinese joint venture companies are not included in the operating profit of the Group as they are accounted for using the equity method. Their profits are included solely in the Group's financial result on a proportionate basis.

## Volkswagen Financial Services

<span id="page-20-0"></span>The business of Volkswagen Financial Services was robust in a demanding environment in 2022. Electrification and digitalization are increasingly reflected in the portfolio of service and mobility offerings.

### **STRUCTURE OF VOLKSWAGEN FINANCIAL SERVICES**

Volkswagen Financial Services comprises dealer and customer financing, leasing, banking and insurance activities, fleet management and mobility services in 47 countries. The key companies are Volkswagen Financial Services AG and its affiliated companies such as Volkswagen Leasing GmbH, as well as Volkswagen Bank GmbH, Porsche Financial Services and the financial services companies in the United States and Canada, the only exceptions being the financial services business of the Scania and Navistar brands and of Porsche Holding Salzburg.

### **BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT**

The NEW AUTO strategy sets out the Volkswagen Group's roadmap for the transformation into a softwareoriented mobility provider and defines the creation and expansion of mobility solutions as an important core element. Volkswagen Financial Services has adopted a key role under this umbrella and incorporated the Group strategy as an integral part of its own MOBILITY2030 strategy. The core task of Volkswagen Financial Services in this context is to develop and provide a comprehensive mobility platform to give customers quick digital and flexible access to mobility – from classic financing and leasing offerings to car subscriptions (Auto-Abo). This marks an expansion of the existing business model from pure-play automotive financial services provider to mobility provider. Volkswagen Financial Services extends and optimizes the automotive value chain for its customers and the Group brand vehicles, thereby increasing vehicle lifetime values.

This is based on pooling resources on a central, Europe-wide marketing platform for used vehicles for all brands of the Volkswagen Group. The aim is to become one of Europe's largest providers of used vehicles and in this way to leverage synergies and tap into additional sources of revenue.

For example, the Europe-wide e-mobility program, "Electrification-as-a-Service" (EaaS), supports the electrification of fleet customers' vehicle pools. The program benefits customers by offering consistent advice and implementation from a single source. Alongside this program, fleet customers are offered new financing for charging infrastructure, which they can use to install the required wallboxes, charging stations, photovoltaic and buffer storage systems.

In the reporting period, partnered by the City of Braunschweig, Volkswagen Financial Services successfully completed a pilot project, unique to Germany, on the digital registration of vehicles by companies. The project is to be used in Germany as a model for a nationwide system and is aimed at allowing legal persons such as companies to register their fleet vehicles online using a specifically developed identification process.

{21}------------------------------------------------

The main refinancing sources for Volkswagen Financial Services are money market and capital market instruments, asset-backed securities (ABS) transactions, customer deposits from the direct banking business and bank credit lines.

In 2022, Volkswagen Financial Services AG issued two bonds with different terms and a total volume of €2.0 billion. Volkswagen Leasing GmbH did not issue any unsecured bonds. Risk premiums in fiscal year 2022 were heavily influenced by the macroeconomic downturn and the turnaround in central bank policies. Driven by gradual increases, premiums approximately doubled in the first half of the year. In the second half of the year, they remained stable or trended slightly downward.

Other bond transactions were conducted in currencies such as pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, Czech korunas, Hong Kong dollars and Japanese yen. In addition, bonds were issued in Australia, Poland, Brazil, Mexico and Türkiye on the basis of local documentation requirements. In addition to this, private placements were issued in various currencies.

Volkswagen Bank did not enter into any transactions with secured or unsecured bonds in the reporting period.

In fiscal year 2022, Volkswagen Leasing GmbH placed three ABS transactions secured by lease receivables with a total volume of €2.75 billion. The issuances met the quality criteria of the STS Securitization Regulation for particularly high-value securitizations and were oversubscribed several times.

Outside Germany, Volkswagen Financial Services issued a total of four ABS transactions in the United States, Canada, China and Japan.

{22}------------------------------------------------

In fiscal year 2022, the number of new financing, leasing, service and insurance contracts from Volkswagen Financial Services signed amounted to 7.8 (7.8) million and was therefore similar to the prior-year figure. At the end of the reporting period, the total number of contracts stood at 22.0 (22.0) million. The number of contracts in the Customer Financing/Leasing area fell by 5.3% to 10.3 million. The Service/ Insurance area accounted for 11.6 million contracts, 4.7% more than in the previous year. With credit eligibility criteria remaining unchanged, the penetration rate, expressed as the ratio of financed or leased vehicles to relevant Group delivery volumes – including the Chinese joint ventures – declined to 32.3 (35.8)%.

On December 31, 2022, Volkswagen Bank GmbH managed 1.3 (1.4) million deposit accounts. Volkswagen Financial Services employed 14,796 people worldwide, including 7,488 in Germany, as of year-end 2022.

### **SALES REVENUE AND EARNINGS**

Volkswagen Financial Services generated sales revenue of €44.2 billion in the reporting period, 6.0% more than in the previous year. The operating result stood at €5.6 (5.7) billion. Strong demand for used vehicles had a positive effect, as did derivatives. However, expenses relating to loss allowances and risk provisions as a consequence of the direct impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict weighed on the operating result.
