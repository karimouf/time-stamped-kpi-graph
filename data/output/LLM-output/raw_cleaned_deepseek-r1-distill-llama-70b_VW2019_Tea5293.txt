RAW OUTPUT

Okay, so I need to extract all the numerical metrics from this provided financial table. Let me start by understanding the structure of the input. The table has headers like "2019.0", "2018.0", and "%". The rows are under "stub_col" and each row has corresponding values under these headers.

First, I'll look at each row in the "rows" array. Each row has four elements: the metric name, the 2019 value, the 2018 value, and the percentage change. For example, the first row is "Deliveries (thousand units)" with values 1243.0, 1254.0, and -0.9.

I need to create a KPI object for each numerical value. That means for each row, I'll have three KPIs: one for 2019, one for 2018, and one for the percentage. But wait, the percentage might not always be a number. In the last row, the percentage is an empty string, so I should set the value to null in that case.

Let me go through each row one by one.

1. **Deliveries (thousand units)**:
   - 2019: 1243.0 thousand units
   - 2018: 1254.0 thousand units
   - %: -0.9 (so this is a percentage, units are '%')

2. **Vehicle sales**:
   - 2019: 1062.0 (units not specified, maybe same as row name? Wait, row name is "Vehicle sales", but the value is just a number. Hmm, the units might be implied, but since it's not specified, I'll put 'N/A'.
   - 2018: 957.0, same units.
   - %: 11, so units are '%'

3. **Production**:
   - 2019: 1243.0 thousand units (since row name says thousand units)
   - 2018: 1285.0 thousand units
   - %: -3.3

4. **Sales revenue (€ million)**:
   - 2019: 19806.0 € million
   - 2018: 17293.0 € million
   - %: 14.5

5. **Operating result**:
   - 2019: 1660.0 (units not specified, so 'N/A')
   - 2018: 1377.0
   - %: 20.6

6. **Operating return on sales (%)**:
   - 2019: 8.4 (unit is %, as per row name)
   - 2018: 8.0
   - %: empty string, so value is null.

Now, for each of these, I need to create a KPI entry. The "name" is the main metric, which is the row name. The "key" would be the column name, which is either "2019.0", "2018.0", or "%". The units depend on the metric. For example, "Deliveries" are in thousand units, so units are "thousand units". For "Vehicle sales", units are 'N/A' since it's not specified.

Wait, but looking back, the row name for "Vehicle sales" doesn't specify units, so I should set units to 'N/A' for those. Similarly, "Production" uses the same units as deliveries, so "thousand units".

I also need to ensure that the row_name and col_name are exactly as they appear. So for each value, row_name is the stub_col entry, and col_name is the merged_headers entry.

Let me structure this step by step.

For each row in rows:
- The first element is the metric name (row_name).
- The next elements are the values under each header (col_name).

So for the first row:
- row_name: "Deliveries (thousand units)"
- col_name for 2019.0: "2019.0", value: 1243.0, units: "thousand units"
- col_name for 2018.0: "2018.0", value: 1254.0, units: "thousand units"
- col_name for "%": "%", value: -0.9, units: "%"

Similarly, for "Vehicle sales":
- row_name: "Vehicle sales"
- 2019.0: 1062.0, units: 'N/A'
- 2018.0: 957.0, units: 'N/A'
- %: 11, units: '%'

Wait, but the percentage for Vehicle sales is 11, which is a percentage, so units should be '%'.

Wait, but in the table, the "%" column is the percentage change between 2019 and 2018. So for each metric, the "%" value represents the percentage change, so units are always '%' for that column.

So, for each row, the third value (after 2019 and 2018) is the percentage, so units are '%', unless it's null.

So, I can structure it as:

For each row in rows:
   for each header in merged_headers:
       if header is "2019.0" or "2018.0":
           units = extract from row_name if possible, else 'N/A'
       else if header is "%":
           units = '%'
       create KPI entry with name, key, units, value, year, row_name, col_name.

Wait, but the year is 2019 as per the input, but the headers have 2019.0 and 2018.0. So for the "2019.0" column, the year is 2019, and for "2018.0", the year is 2018.

So, in the KPI objects, the year should correspond to the column's year. So for "2019.0", year is 2019, for "2018.0", year is 2018, and for "%", since it's the change between these years, but the year in the KPI would be null or perhaps 2019 as it's the base year? Wait, the problem says to capture the time periods, so perhaps for the percentage, the year is the same as the base year, which is 2019.

Wait, looking back at the guidelines: "Identify time periods (years, quarters, etc.)". So for each value, the year is the one from the column header. So "2019.0" is 2019, "2018.0" is 2018, and "%" is a calculated value between these two years, but the year for the percentage might be considered as 2019 since it's the later year.

But the problem says to extract all numerical metrics, so perhaps the percentage is treated as a metric for 2019. Alternatively, maybe the year isn't applicable for the percentage, but the problem expects a year for each KPI. Hmm, the input's "year" is 2019, but each column has its own year.

Wait, looking at the sample input, the "year" is 2019, but the table includes 2018 data as well. So each KPI's year should be based on the column's year. So for "2019.0" column, year is 2019; for "2018.0", year is 2018; for "%", perhaps the year is 2019 as it's the base year for the percentage change.

Alternatively, maybe the percentage doesn't have a specific year, but the problem expects to include it. Since the problem says to extract all numerical metrics, including the percentage, I think the year for the percentage should be 2019, as it's the year of the report.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the sample input's structure. The input has a "year" field as 2019, but the table includes both 2019 and 2018 data. So each column represents a different year. Therefore, for each value in "2019.0", the year is 2019; for "2018.0", it's 2018; and for "%", perhaps it's 2019 as well, since it's the change from 2018 to 2019.

==================================================
CLEANED OUTPUT
==================================================

 
Okay, so I need to extract all the numerical metrics from this provided financial table. Let me start by understanding the structure of the input. The table has headers like "2019.0", "2018.0", and "%". The rows are under "stub_col" and each row has corresponding values under these headers.

First, I'll look at each row in the "rows" array. Each row has four elements: the metric name, the 2019 value, the 2018 value, and the percentage change. For example, the first row is "Deliveries (thousand units)" with values 1243.0, 1254.0, and -0.9.

I need to create a KPI object for each numerical value. That means for each row, I'll have three KPIs: one for 2019, one for 2018, and one for the percentage. But wait, the percentage might not always be a number. In the last row, the percentage is an empty string, so I should set the value to null in that case.

Let me go through each row one by one.

1. **Deliveries (thousand units)**:
   - 2019: 1243.0 thousand units
   - 2018: 1254.0 thousand units
   - %: -0.9 (so this is a percentage, units are '%')

2. **Vehicle sales**:
   - 2019: 1062.0 (units not specified, maybe same as row name? Wait, row name is "Vehicle sales", but the value is just a number. Hmm, the units might be implied, but since it's not specified, I'll put 'N/A'.
   - 2018: 957.0, same units.
   - %: 11, so units are '%'

3. **Production**:
   - 2019: 1243.0 thousand units (since row name says thousand units)
   - 2018: 1285.0 thousand units
   - %: -3.3

4. **Sales revenue (€ million)**:
   - 2019: 19806.0 € million
   - 2018: 17293.0 € million
   - %: 14.5

5. **Operating result**:
   - 2019: 1660.0 (units not specified, so 'N/A')
   - 2018: 1377.0
   - %: 20.6

6. **Operating return on sales (%)**:
   - 2019: 8.4 (unit is %, as per row name)
   - 2018: 8.0
   - %: empty string, so value is null.

Now, for each of these, I need to create a KPI entry. The "name" is the main metric, which is the row name. The "key" would be the column name, which is either "2019.0", "2018.0", or "%". The units depend on the metric. For example, "Deliveries" are in thousand units, so units are "thousand units". For "Vehicle sales", units are 'N/A' since it's not specified.

Wait, but looking back, the row name for "Vehicle sales" doesn't specify units, so I should set units to 'N/A' for those. Similarly, "Production" uses the same units as deliveries, so "thousand units".

I also need to ensure that the row_name and col_name are exactly as they appear. So for each value, row_name is the stub_col entry, and col_name is the merged_headers entry.

Let me structure this step by step.

For each row in rows:
- The first element is the metric name (row_name).
- The next elements are the values under each header (col_name).

So for the first row:
- row_name: "Deliveries (thousand units)"
- col_name for 2019.0: "2019.0", value: 1243.0, units: "thousand units"
- col_name for 2018.0: "2018.0", value: 1254.0, units: "thousand units"
- col_name for "%": "%", value: -0.9, units: "%"

Similarly, for "Vehicle sales":
- row_name: "Vehicle sales"
- 2019.0: 1062.0, units: 'N/A'
- 2018.0: 957.0, units: 'N/A'
- %: 11, units: '%'

Wait, but the percentage for Vehicle sales is 11, which is a percentage, so units should be '%'.

Wait, but in the table, the "%" column is the percentage change between 2019 and 2018. So for each metric, the "%" value represents the percentage change, so units are always '%' for that column.

So, for each row, the third value (after 2019 and 2018) is the percentage, so units are '%', unless it's null.

So, I can structure it as:

For each row in rows:
   for each header in merged_headers:
       if header is "2019.0" or "2018.0":
           units = extract from row_name if possible, else 'N/A'
       else if header is "%":
           units = '%'
       create KPI entry with name, key, units, value, year, row_name, col_name.

Wait, but the year is 2019 as per the input, but the headers have 2019.0 and 2018.0. So for the "2019.0" column, the year is 2019, and for "2018.0", the year is 2018.

So, in the KPI objects, the year should correspond to the column's year. So for "2019.0", year is 2019, for "2018.0", year is 2018, and for "%", since it's the change between these years, but the year in the KPI would be null or perhaps 2019 as it's the base year? Wait, the problem says to capture the time periods, so perhaps for the percentage, the year is the same as the base year, which is 2019.

Wait, looking back at the guidelines: "Identify time periods (years, quarters, etc.)". So for each value, the year is the one from the column header. So "2019.0" is 2019, "2018.0" is 2018, and "%" is a calculated value between these two years, but the year for the percentage might be considered as 2019 since it's the later year.

But the problem says to extract all numerical metrics, so perhaps the percentage is treated as a metric for 2019. Alternatively, maybe the year isn't applicable for the percentage, but the problem expects a year for each KPI. Hmm, the input's "year" is 2019, but each column has its own year.

Wait, looking at the sample input, the "year" is 2019, but the table includes 2018 data as well. So each KPI's year should be based on the column's year. So for "2019.0" column, year is 2019; for "2018.0", year is 2018; for "%", perhaps the year is 2019 as it's the base year for the percentage change.

Alternatively, maybe the percentage doesn't have a specific year, but the problem expects to include it. Since the problem says to extract all numerical metrics, including the percentage, I think the year for the percentage should be 2019, as it's the year of the report.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the sample input's structure. The input has a "year" field as 2019, but the table includes both 2019 and 2018 data. So each column represents a different year. Therefore, for each value in "2019.0", the year is 2019; for "2018.0", it's 2018; and for "%", perhaps it's 2019 as well, since it's the change from 2018 to 2019.
