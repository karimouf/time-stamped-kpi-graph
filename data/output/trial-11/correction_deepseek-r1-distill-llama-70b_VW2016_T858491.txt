==================================================
CORRECTION PROMPT
==================================================

The following KPIs are INVALID. Fix them using validation errors.

CRITICAL: The PRIMARY validation is based on row_idx and col_idx (the indices that access the cell).
- row_name and col_name are SECONDARY validation only
- If there's a mismatch, FIX THE INDICES (row_idx/col_idx), NOT the names
- The correct cell is at: data[row_idx][col_idx] = rows[row_idx][col_idx]
- After fixing indices, row_name MUST equal stub_col[row_idx]
- After fixing indices, col_name MUST equal merged_headers[col_idx]

HOW TO FIX ERRORS:

1. KEY = NAME ERROR (IDENTICAL VALUES):
   - This means "key" and "name" have the same value, which is not allowed
   - SOLUTION: Search the table to understand what this KPI represents
   - Look at the table's title, section_name, and context
   - "name" = the KPI metric (what is being measured) - usually from row label (stub_col) or table title
   - "key" = the entity/segment (what/who it applies to) - from context, section, or broader category
   
   EXAMPLES:
   - Table: "Volkswagen Passenger Cars - Production" with row "Golf"
     → name: "Production" (from title), key: "Golf" (from row)
   - Table: "Key Figures" with rows "Sales revenue", "Operating profit"
     → name: "Sales revenue"/"Operating profit" (from row), key: "Company"/"Volkswagen Group" (from context)
   - Table: "Brand Production" with row "Audi" 
     → name: "Production" (from title), key: "Audi" (from row)

2. VALUE MISMATCH: Adjust row_idx or col_idx to point to the cell with the correct value
   - Check if value appears in adjacent cells (row_idx±1 or col_idx±1)
   - Update row_idx/col_idx to the correct position
   - Then update row_name = stub_col[row_idx] and col_name = merged_headers[col_idx]

3. ROW_NAME MISMATCH: The row_idx is pointing to wrong row
   - Find the correct row_idx where stub_col[row_idx] matches the intended row
   - Update row_idx to the correct value
   - Keep row_name as stub_col[row_idx] (don't change the name to match wrong index!)

4. COL_NAME MISMATCH: The col_idx is pointing to wrong column
   - Find the correct col_idx where merged_headers[col_idx] matches the intended year/column
   - Update col_idx to the correct value
   - Keep col_name as merged_headers[col_idx] (don't change the name to match wrong index!)

5. EUROPEAN DECIMALS: Handle comma as decimal separator
   - "1,4864" → 1.4864
   - "−2,5" → -2.5

REMEMBER: 
- Fix indices first, then names will automatically align with stub_col and merged_headers!
- For key=name errors, determine the correct "name" (metric) and "key" (entity) from table context

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm seeing multiple validation errors related to KPIs, specifically issues with `row_idx` and `col_idx` mismatches. The primary validation relies on these indices, so it's crucial to fix them correctly. Here's how I would approach resolving these errors:

### Understanding the Problem
1. **Primary Validation**: The correct cell is determined by `data[row_idx][col_idx]`, which should match `rows[row_idx][col_idx]`.
2. **Secondary Validation**: After fixing the indices, `row_name` must match `stub_col[row_idx]` and `col_name` must match `merged_headers[col_idx]`.
3. **Common Issues**:
   - **Row Mismatch**: The `row_name` in the KPI doesn't match the value in `stub_col` at the given `row_idx`.
   - **Column Mismatch**: The `col_name` in the KPI doesn't match the value in `merged_headers` at the given `col_idx`.
   - **Value Mismatch**: The extracted value doesn't match the source value, indicating a potential error in data extraction or indexing.

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### 1. **Fixing Row Indices (`row_idx`)**:
   - **Problem**: For multiple KPIs, `row_name` doesn't match `stub_col[row_idx]`. For example, `stub_col[12]` is "Income Statement" but the KPI's `row_name` is "Sales revenue".
   - **Solution**: 
     - Search `stub_col` for the correct `row_idx` where the value matches the KPI's `row_name`.
     - Update `row_idx` and `row_name` accordingly.
     - For instance, if `stub_col[13]` is "Sales revenue", update `row_idx` from 12 to 13 and set `row_name` to "Sales revenue".

#### 2. **Fixing Column Indices (`col_idx`)**:
   - **Problem**: The `col_name` in the KPI doesn't match `merged_headers[col_idx]`. For example, `merged_headers[1]` is empty but the KPI's `col_name` is "2016.0".
   - **Solution**:
     - Search `merged_headers` for the correct `col_idx` where the value matches the KPI's `col_name`.
     - Update `col_idx` and `col_name` accordingly.
     - If `merged_headers` doesn't have the expected values, ensure that `merged_headers` is correctly populated or adjust the `col_idx` based on the data structure.

#### 3. **Resolving Value Mismatches**:
   - **Problem**: The extracted value doesn't match the source value, leading to large discrepancies.
   - **Solution**:
     - Verify the data extraction process to ensure accuracy.
     - If the extracted value is correct but doesn't match the source, check the source data for errors.
     - If the issue persists, manually adjust the indices to point to the correct cell where the extracted value matches the source.

### Example Fixes

#### **KPI 1: Sales revenue (2016)**
- **Issue**: `row_idx=12` points to "Income Statement" instead of "Sales revenue".
- **Fix**: Update `row_idx` to 13 and `row_name` to "Sales revenue".
- **Result**:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Sales revenue",
    "key": "",
    "units": "€ million",
    "value": 217267.0,
    "year": 2016,
    "row_name": "Sales revenue",
    "row_idx": 13,
    "col_name": "2016.0",
    "col_idx": 1,
    "source_model": "deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b"
  }
  ```

#### **KPI 6: Cost of sales (2016)**
- **Issue**: `row_idx=13` points to "Sales revenue" instead of "Cost of sales".
- **Fix**: Update `row_idx` to 14 and `row_name` to "Cost of sales".
- **Result**:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Cost of sales",
    "key": "",
    "units": "€ million",
    "value": 176270.0,
    "year": 2016,
    "row_name": "Cost of sales",
    "row_idx": 14,
    "col_name": "2016.0",
    "col_idx": 1,
    "source_model": "deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b"
  }
  ```

### Final Thoughts
By systematically addressing each validation error, ensuring that `row_idx` and `col_idx` point to the correct data, and verifying the extracted values against the source, we can resolve these KPI validation issues effectively. It's essential to prioritize fixing the indices first, as they are the primary keys for data access, and then ensure that the secondary validations align accordingly.

CORRECTION PROMPT
==================================================

The following KPIs are INVALID. Fix them using validation errors.

CRITICAL: The PRIMARY validation is based on row_idx and col_idx (the indices that access the cell).
- row_name and col_name are SECONDARY validation only
- If there's a mismatch, FIX THE INDICES (row_idx/col_idx), NOT the names
- The correct cell is at: data[row_idx][col_idx] = rows[row_idx][col_idx]
- After fixing indices, row_name MUST equal stub_col[row_idx]
- After fixing indices, col_name MUST equal merged_headers[col_idx]

HOW TO FIX ERRORS:

1. KEY = NAME ERROR (IDENTICAL VALUES):
   - This means "key" and "name" have the same value, which is not allowed
   - SOLUTION: Search the table to understand what this KPI represents
   - Look at the table's title, section_name, and context
   - "name" = the KPI metric (what is being measured) - usually from row label (stub_col) or table title
   - "key" = the entity/segment (what/who it applies to) - from context, section, or broader category
   
   EXAMPLES:
   - Table: "Volkswagen Passenger Cars - Production" with row "Golf"
     → name: "Production" (from title), key: "Golf" (from row)
   - Table: "Key Figures" with rows "Sales revenue", "Operating profit"
     → name: "Sales revenue"/"Operating profit" (from row), key: "Company"/"Volkswagen Group" (from context)
   - Table: "Brand Production" with row "Audi" 
     → name: "Production" (from title), key: "Audi" (from row)

2. VALUE MISMATCH: Adjust row_idx or col_idx to point to the cell with the correct value
   - Check if value appears in adjacent cells (row_idx±1 or col_idx±1)
   - Update row_idx/col_idx to the correct position
   - Then update row_name = stub_col[row_idx] and col_name = merged_headers[col_idx]

3. ROW_NAME MISMATCH: The row_idx is pointing to wrong row
   - Find the correct row_idx where stub_col[row_idx] matches the intended row
   - Update row_idx to the correct value
   - Keep row_name as stub_col[row_idx] (don't change the name to match wrong index!)

4. COL_NAME MISMATCH: The col_idx is pointing to wrong column
   - Find the correct col_idx where merged_headers[col_idx] matches the intended year/column
   - Update col_idx to the correct value
   - Keep col_name as merged_headers[col_idx] (don't change the name to match wrong index!)

5. EUROPEAN DECIMALS: Handle comma as decimal separator
   - "1,4864" → 1.4864
   - "−2,5" → -2.5

REMEMBER: 
- Fix indices first, then names will automatically align with stub_col and merged_headers!
- For key=name errors, determine the correct "name" (metric) and "key" (entity) from table context

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm seeing multiple KPI entries that have validation errors, specifically mismatches in row and column indices, as well as large discrepancies in the values extracted versus the source data. My goal is to fix these KPIs by adjusting the indices and ensuring that the row and column names match the corrected indices.

First, I'll start by understanding the structure of the data. It seems like there's a table with rows and columns, where each row is identified by a `row_name` and each column by a `col_name`. The `row_idx` and `col_idx` are the indices that point to the correct cell in the data array. The `stub_col` array contains the row names, and `merged_headers` contains the column names.

Looking at the first error:

**ERROR 1:**
- **KPI:** `"name": "Vehicle sales", "key": "Germany", "units": "units", "value": 1257.0, "year": 2016`
- **Issues:** 
  - `row_name` mismatch: KPI='Germany' vs. `stub_col[2]`='Vehicle sales (units)'
  - `col_name` mismatch: KPI='2016.0' vs. `merged_headers[1]`=''
  - Large value discrepancy: Extracted=1257.0 vs. Source=10391.0

**Solution:**
1. **Fixing `row_idx`:** The current `row_idx` is 2, but `stub_col[2]` is 'Vehicle sales (units)', not 'Germany'. I need to find the correct `row_idx` where `stub_col[row_idx]` equals 'Germany'. From the data, it seems `stub_col[3]` is 'Germany', so I'll update `row_idx` from 2 to 3.
   
2. **Fixing `col_idx`:** The current `col_idx` is 1, but `merged_headers[1]` is empty, not '2016.0'. I need to find the correct `col_idx` where `merged_headers[col_idx]` equals '2016.0'. However, from the provided data, it seems `merged_headers` are mostly empty. This might indicate an issue with the column headers. For now, I'll keep `col_idx` as 1, assuming that the column headers might be incorrectly mapped or missing.

3. **Fixing the value mismatch:** The extracted value (1257.0) doesn't match the source value (10391.0). This suggests that the current indices are pointing to the wrong cell. After updating `row_idx` to 3, I'll check the value at `data[3][1]`. If it matches the extracted value (1257.0), then the indices are correct. If not, I might need to adjust `col_idx` accordingly.

Repeating this process for all the errors, I'll adjust the `row_idx` and `col_idx` to point to the correct cells where the values match the extracted data. After fixing the indices, I'll ensure that the `row_name` and `col_name` are updated to reflect the new indices.

Here's how the corrected KPIs should look:
