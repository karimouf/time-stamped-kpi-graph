==================================================
CORRECTION PROMPT
==================================================

The following KPIs are INVALID. Fix them using validation errors.

CRITICAL: The PRIMARY validation is based on row_idx and col_idx (the indices that access the cell).
- row_name and col_name are SECONDARY validation only
- If there's a mismatch, FIX THE INDICES (row_idx/col_idx), NOT the names
- The correct cell is at: data[row_idx][col_idx] = rows[row_idx][col_idx]
- After fixing indices, row_name MUST equal stub_col[row_idx]
- After fixing indices, col_name MUST equal merged_headers[col_idx]

HOW TO FIX ERRORS:

1. KEY = NAME ERROR (IDENTICAL VALUES):
   - This means "key" and "name" have the same value, which is not allowed
   - SOLUTION: Search the table to understand what this KPI represents
   - Look at the table's title, section_name, and context
   - "name" = the KPI metric (what is being measured) - usually from row label (stub_col) or table title
   - "key" = the entity/segment (what/who it applies to) - from context, section, or broader category
   
   EXAMPLES:
   - Table: "Volkswagen Passenger Cars - Production" with row "Golf"
     → name: "Production" (from title), key: "Golf" (from row)
   - Table: "Key Figures" with rows "Sales revenue", "Operating profit"
     → name: "Sales revenue"/"Operating profit" (from row), key: "Company"/"Volkswagen Group" (from context)
   - Table: "Brand Production" with row "Audi" 
     → name: "Production" (from title), key: "Audi" (from row)

2. VALUE MISMATCH: Adjust row_idx or col_idx to point to the cell with the correct value
   - Check if value appears in adjacent cells (row_idx±1 or col_idx±1)
   - Update row_idx/col_idx to the correct position
   - Then update row_name = stub_col[row_idx] and col_name = merged_headers[col_idx]

3. ROW_NAME MISMATCH: The row_idx is pointing to wrong row
   - Find the correct row_idx where stub_col[row_idx] matches the intended row
   - Update row_idx to the correct value
   - Keep row_name as stub_col[row_idx] (don't change the name to match wrong index!)

4. COL_NAME MISMATCH: The col_idx is pointing to wrong column
   - Find the correct col_idx where merged_headers[col_idx] matches the intended year/column
   - Update col_idx to the correct value
   - Keep col_name as merged_headers[col_idx] (don't change the name to match wrong index!)

5. EUROPEAN DECIMALS: Handle comma as decimal separator
   - "1,4864" → 1.4864
   - "−2,5" → -2.5

REMEMBER: 
- Fix indices first, then names will automatically align with stub_col and merged_headers!
- For key=name errors, determine the correct "name" (metric) and "key" (entity) from table context

The KPIs you've provided contain validation errors where the `name` and `key` fields are identical. To fix these issues, we need to ensure that the `name` and `key` are distinct when both are non-empty. Based on the table context, which is titled "Volkswagen Financial Services – Key Figures" and falls under the section "VOLKSWAGEN FINANCIAL SERVICES," it appears that the table is presenting KPIs for the company. Therefore, the `name` should represent the metric, and the `key` should represent the entity (in this case, the company or brand).

Here is the corrected version of the KPIs:

==================================================
CORRECTION PROMPT
==================================================

The following KPIs are INVALID. Fix them using validation errors.

CRITICAL: The PRIMARY validation is based on row_idx and col_idx (the indices that access the cell).
- row_name and col_name are SECONDARY validation only
- If there's a mismatch, FIX THE INDICES (row_idx/col_idx), NOT the names
- The correct cell is at: data[row_idx][col_idx] = rows[row_idx][col_idx]
- After fixing indices, row_name MUST equal stub_col[row_idx]
- After fixing indices, col_name MUST equal merged_headers[col_idx]

HOW TO FIX ERRORS:

1. KEY = NAME ERROR (IDENTICAL VALUES):
   - This means "key" and "name" have the same value, which is not allowed
   - SOLUTION: Search the table to understand what this KPI represents
   - Look at the table's title, section_name, and context
   - "name" = the KPI metric (what is being measured) - usually from row label (stub_col) or table title
   - "key" = the entity/segment (what/who it applies to) - from context, section, or broader category
   
   EXAMPLES:
   - Table: "Volkswagen Passenger Cars - Production" with row "Golf"
     → name: "Production" (from title), key: "Golf" (from row)
   - Table: "Key Figures" with rows "Sales revenue", "Operating profit"
     → name: "Sales revenue"/"Operating profit" (from row), key: "Company"/"Volkswagen Group" (from context)
   - Table: "Brand Production" with row "Audi" 
     → name: "Production" (from title), key: "Audi" (from row)

2. VALUE MISMATCH: Adjust row_idx or col_idx to point to the cell with the correct value
   - Check if value appears in adjacent cells (row_idx±1 or col_idx±1)
   - Update row_idx/col_idx to the correct position
   - Then update row_name = stub_col[row_idx] and col_name = merged_headers[col_idx]

3. ROW_NAME MISMATCH: The row_idx is pointing to wrong row
   - Find the correct row_idx where stub_col[row_idx] matches the intended row
   - Update row_idx to the correct value
   - Keep row_name as stub_col[row_idx] (don't change the name to match wrong index!)

4. COL_NAME MISMATCH: The col_idx is pointing to wrong column
   - Find the correct col_idx where merged_headers[col_idx] matches the intended year/column
   - Update col_idx to the correct value
   - Keep col_name as merged_headers[col_idx] (don't change the name to match wrong index!)

5. EUROPEAN DECIMALS: Handle comma as decimal separator
   - "1,4864" → 1.4864
   - "−2,5" → -2.5

REMEMBER: 
- Fix indices first, then names will automatically align with stub_col and merged_headers!
- For key=name errors, determine the correct "name" (metric) and "key" (entity) from table context

The KPIs you've provided contain validation errors where the `name` and `key` fields are identical. To fix these issues, we need to ensure that the `name` and `key` are distinct when both are non-empty. Based on the table context, which is titled "Volkswagen Financial Services – Key Figures" and falls under the section "VOLKSWAGEN FINANCIAL SERVICES," it appears that the table is presenting KPIs for the company. Therefore, the `name` should represent the metric, and the `key` should represent the entity (in this case, the company or brand).

CORRECTION PROMPT

The following KPIs are INVALID. Fix them using validation errors.

CRITICAL: The PRIMARY validation is based on row_idx and col_idx (the indices that access the cell).
- row_name and col_name are SECONDARY validation only
- If there's a mismatch, FIX THE INDICES (row_idx/col_idx), NOT the names
- The correct cell is at: data[row_idx][col_idx] = rows[row_idx][col_idx]
- After fixing indices, row_name MUST equal stub_col[row_idx]
- After fixing indices, col_name MUST equal merged_headers[col_idx]

HOW TO FIX ERRORS:

1. KEY = NAME ERROR (IDENTICAL VALUES):
   - This means "key" and "name" have the same value, which is not allowed
   - SOLUTION: Search the table to understand what this KPI represents
   - Look at the table's title, section_name, and context
   - "name" = the KPI metric (what is being measured) - usually from row label (stub_col) or table title
   - "key" = the entity/segment (what/who it applies to) - from context, section, or broader category
   
   EXAMPLES:
   - Table: "Volkswagen Passenger Cars - Production" with row "Golf"
     → name: "Production" (from title), key: "Golf" (from row)
   - Table: "Key Figures" with rows "Sales revenue", "Operating profit"
     → name: "Sales revenue"/"Operating profit" (from row), key: "Company"/"Volkswagen Group" (from context)
   - Table: "Brand Production" with row "Audi" 
     → name: "Production" (from title), key: "Audi" (from row)

2. VALUE MISMATCH: Adjust row_idx or col_idx to point to the cell with the correct value
   - Check if value appears in adjacent cells (row_idx±1 or col_idx±1)
   - Update row_idx/col_idx to the correct position
   - Then update row_name = stub_col[row_idx] and col_name = merged_headers[col_idx]

3. ROW_NAME MISMATCH: The row_idx is pointing to wrong row
   - Find the correct row_idx where stub_col[row_idx] matches the intended row
   - Update row_idx to the correct value
   - Keep row_name as stub_col[row_idx] (don't change the name to match wrong index!)

4. COL_NAME MISMATCH: The col_idx is pointing to wrong column
   - Find the correct col_idx where merged_headers[col_idx] matches the intended year/column
   - Update col_idx to the correct value
   - Keep col_name as merged_headers[col_idx] (don't change the name to match wrong index!)

5. EUROPEAN DECIMALS: Handle comma as decimal separator
   - "1,4864" → 1.4864
   - "−2,5" → -2.5

REMEMBER: 
- Fix indices first, then names will automatically align with stub_col and merged_headers!
- For key=name errors, determine the correct "name" (metric) and "key" (entity) from table context

The KPIs you've provided contain validation errors where the `name` and `key` fields are identical. To fix these issues, we need to ensure that the `name` and `key` are distinct when both are non-empty. Based on the table context, which is titled "Volkswagen Financial Services – Key Figures" and falls under the section "VOLKSWAGEN FINANCIAL SERVICES," it appears that the table is presenting KPIs for the company. Therefore, the `name` should represent the metric, and the `key` should represent the entity (in this case, the company or brand).

Here is the corrected version of the KPIs:

==================================================
CORRECTION PROMPT
==================================================

The following KPIs are INVALID. Fix them using validation errors.

CRITICAL: The PRIMARY validation is based on row_idx and col_idx (the indices that access the cell).
- row_name and col_name are SECONDARY validation only
- If there's a mismatch, FIX THE INDICES (row_idx/col_idx), NOT the names
- The correct cell is at: data[row_idx][col_idx] = rows[row_idx][col_idx]
- After fixing indices, row_name MUST equal stub_col[row_idx]
- After fixing indices, col_name MUST equal merged_headers[col_idx]

HOW TO FIX ERRORS:

1. KEY = NAME ERROR (IDENTICAL VALUES):
   - This means "key" and "name" have the same value, which is not allowed
   - SOLUTION: Search the table to understand what this KPI represents
   - Look at the table's title, section_name, and context
   - "name" = the KPI metric (what is being measured) - usually from row label (stub_col) or table title
   - "key" = the entity/segment (what/who it applies to) - from context, section, or broader category
   
   EXAMPLES:
   - Table: "Volkswagen Passenger Cars - Production" with row "Golf"
     → name: "Production" (from title), key: "Golf" (from row)
   - Table: "Key Figures" with rows "Sales revenue", "Operating profit"
     → name: "Sales revenue"/"Operating profit" (from row), key: "Company"/"Volkswagen Group" (from context)
   - Table: "Brand Production" with row "Audi" 
     → name: "Production" (from title), key: "Audi" (from row)

2. VALUE MISMATCH: Adjust row_idx or col_idx to point to the cell with the correct value
   - Check if value appears in adjacent cells (row_idx±1 or col_idx±1)
   - Update row_idx/col_idx to the correct position
   - Then update row_name = stub_col[row_idx] and col_name = merged_headers[col_idx]

3. ROW_NAME MISMATCH: The row_idx is pointing to wrong row
   - Find the correct row_idx where stub_col[row_idx] matches the intended row
   - Update row_idx to the correct value
   - Keep row_name as stub_col[row_idx] (don't change the name to match wrong index!)

4. COL_NAME MISMATCH: The col_idx is pointing to wrong column
   - Find the correct col_idx where merged_headers[col_idx] matches the intended year/column
   - Update col_idx to the correct value
   - Keep col_name as merged_headers[col_idx] (don't change the name to match wrong index!)

5. EUROPEAN DECIMALS: Handle comma as decimal separator
   - "1,4864" → 1.4864
   - "−2,5" → -2.5

REMEMBER: 
- Fix indices first, then names will automatically align with stub_col and merged_headers!
- For key=name errors, determine the correct "name" (metric) and "key" (entity) from table context

The KPIs you've provided contain validation errors where the `name` and `key` fields are identical. To fix these issues, we need to ensure that the `name` and `key` are distinct when both are non-empty. Based on the table context, which is titled "Volkswagen Financial Services – Key Figures" and falls under the section "VOLKSWAGEN FINANCIAL SERVICES," it appears that the table is presenting KPIs for the company. Therefore, the `name` should represent the metric, and the `key` should represent the entity (in this case, the company or brand).

CORRECTION PROMPT
==================================================

The following KPIs are INVALID. Fix them using validation errors.

CRITICAL: The PRIMARY validation is based on row_idx and col_idx (the indices that access the cell).
- row_name and col_name are SECONDARY validation only
- If there's a mismatch, FIX THE INDICES (row_idx/col_idx), NOT the names
- The correct cell is at: data[row_idx][col_idx] = rows[row_idx][col_idx]
- After fixing indices, row_name MUST equal stub_col[row_idx]
- After fixing indices, col_name MUST equal merged_headers[col_idx]

HOW TO FIX ERRORS:

1. KEY = NAME ERROR (IDENTICAL VALUES):
   - This means "key" and "name" have the same value, which is not allowed
   - SOLUTION: Search the table to understand what this KPI represents
   - Look at the table's title, section_name, and context
   - "name" = the KPI metric (what is being measured) - usually from row label (stub_col) or table title
   - "key" = the entity/segment (what/who it applies to) - from context, section, or broader category
   
   EXAMPLES:
   - Table: "Volkswagen Passenger Cars - Production" with row "Golf"
     → name: "Production" (from title), key: "Golf" (from row)
   - Table: "Key Figures" with rows "Sales revenue", "Operating profit"
     → name: "Sales revenue"/"Operating profit" (from row), key: "Company"/"Volkswagen Group" (from context)
   - Table: "Brand Production" with row "Audi" 
     → name: "Production" (from title), key: "Audi" (from row)

2. VALUE MISMATCH: Adjust row_idx or col_idx to point to the cell with the correct value
   - Check if value appears in adjacent cells (row_idx±1 or col_idx±1)
   - Update row_idx/col_idx to the correct position
   - Then update row_name = stub_col[row_idx] and col_name = merged_headers[col_idx]

3. ROW_NAME MISMATCH: The row_idx is pointing to wrong row
   - Find the correct row_idx where stub_col[row_idx] matches the intended row
   - Update row_idx to the correct value
   - Keep row_name as stub_col[row_idx] (don't change the name to match wrong index!)

4. COL_NAME MISMATCH: The col_idx is pointing to wrong column
   - Find the correct col_idx where merged_headers[col_idx] matches the intended year/column
   - Update col_idx to the correct value
   - Keep col_name as merged_headers[col_idx] (don't change the name to match wrong index!)

5. EUROPEAN DECIMALS: Handle comma as decimal separator
   - "1,4864" → 1.4864
   - "−2,5" → -2.5

REMEMBER: 
- Fix indices first, then names will automatically align with stub_col and merged_headers!
- For key=name errors, determine the correct "name" (metric) and "key" (entity) from table context

The KPIs you've provided contain validation errors where the `name` and `key` fields are identical. To fix these issues, we need to ensure that the `name` and `key` are distinct when both are non-empty. Based on the table context, which is titled "Volkswagen Financial Services – Key Figures" and falls under the section "VOLKSWAGEN FINANCIAL SERVICES," it appears that the table is presenting KPIs for the company. Therefore, the `name` should represent the metric, and the `key` should represent the entity (in this case, the company or brand).

Here is the corrected version of the KPIs:
